The course will offer a general perspective on the Lagrangian approach to turbulence,
from fundamental understanding to new ideas. It will cover the following topics

1. Multifractal approach to Lagrangian intermittency and irreversibility
2.  Lagrangian view of scalar transport
3.  Inertial and active particles in turbulence
