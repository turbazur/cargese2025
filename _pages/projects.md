(The list is purely indicative at this point)

1. **FRG fixed points of the 1D Burgers equation for randomly stirred fluids.** (LC) The project aims to derive the FRG flow equations for the 1D stochastic Burgers equation in a simple approximation, integrate numerically these equations to find the fixed point structure of the 1D Burgers equation and analyse the different scaling regimes.


1. **Lagrangian intermittency and irreversibility**  (MC)
I can use a small DB of Lagrangian trajectories to do some analysis of
Lagrangian structure functions and or Lagrangian power to discuss
irreversibility.
Eventually, the students can also do some conditional statistics. For
more motivated students I can also propose to do some simulations with
the shell model in its Lagrangian version. For the latter I can
provide a working C code.
 
1. **Anomalous scaling in passive scalars** (MC)
I can provide some fields of 2D scalar fields in 2D turbulence in the
inverse cascade and suggest some data analysis, such as structure
functions or analysis of the multipliers. On this I may ask Chiara
some help so that she can eventually tutor the students when I leave.

1. **Reversible Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq** (BD)

1. **Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard equations on log lattice** (BD)

1. **Spontaneous stochasticity in Reversible Navier-Stokes** (BD)

1. **Zero-modes in a 1D multifractal random of scalar transport** (ST)
The project aims to analyse numerically and theoretically the emergence of non-Gaussian flatness in multifractal extension of random dyadic model, which can be seen as a shell model version of the Kraichnan model of scalar transport.

1. **Predictability of Kelvin-Helmholtz rings in $\alpha$-turbulence** (ST)
The 2D Kelvin-Helmoltz instability perturbed by a small noise is known to give rise to spontaneous stochasticity of vortex sheets. The goal is to numerically investigate the universality of this mechanism when varying the range of interactions between the vortices.

1. **Inverse cascades in entropic shell models** (ST)
The effective 0d nature of classical shell models prevents them to efficiently mimic dual cascade dynamics, in particular in connection to 2D flows. The goal of the project is to explore a continuous modification controlled by an effective dimension $d\in \mathbb R$, that consists in altering  the dynamical invariants to restore correct interplay between equilibrium and flux solutions.

1. **Spontaneous stochasticity of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation**  (ES)

1. **Two-Point Statistics from Fiber Tracking Velocimetry in a turbulent channel flow** (CB)
This project aims at evaluating two-point statistics of a turbulent channel flow using rigid fibers transported by the flow. This technique, recently validated experimentally and numerically in homogeneous isotropic turbulence (Brizzolara et al., PRX, 2021), allows to measure flow transverse velocity increments and even the local turbulent dissipation rate for sufficiently short fibers. Using numerical data, we will apply this technique to a turbulent channel flow, which is inhomogenous and anisotropic. The length and inertia of the fibers will be varied to quantify the effect of these parameters on the measurements.

1. **Dynamical models for the turbulent cascade** (JB)
This project explores simplified dynamical models for the turbulent energy cascade that go beyond phenomenological approaches. The aim is to understand how intermittency, as described by Kolmogorov's 1962 refined self-similarity hypothesis, emerges dynamically from the coupling between scales. Students will construct and analyze stochastic evolution equations for coarse-grained energy transfers, investigating how fluctuations at small scales lead to intermittent statistics. A central aspect is to illustrate Eulerian spontaneous stochasticity, viewed through the lens of renormalization-group ideas, where multiplicative randomness arises from unresolved interactions. Model predictions will be compared with direct numerical simulations, focusing on scaling exponents, intermittency corrections, and the validity of refined similarity across scales.
