(The list is purely indicative at this point)
1. **FRG fixed points of the 1D Burgers equation for randomly stirred fluids.** (LC) The project aims to derive the FRG flow equations for the 1D stochastic Burgers equation in a simple approximation, integrate numerically these equations to find the fixed point structure of the 1D Burgers equation and analyse the different scaling regimes.


1. **Lagrangian intermittency and irreversibility**  (MC)
I can use a small DB of Lagrangian trajectories to do some analysis of
Lagrangian structure functions and or Lagrangian power to discuss
irreversibility.
Eventually, the students can also do some conditional statistics. For
more motivated students I can also propose to do some simulations with
the shell model in its Lagrangian version. For the latter I can
provide a working C code.
 
1. **Anomalous scaling in passive scalars** (MC)
I can provide some fields of 2D scalar fields in 2D turbulence in the
inverse cascade and suggest some data analysis, such as structure
functions or analysis of the multipliers. 

1. **Spontaneous stochasticity in Reversible Navier-Stokes** (BD)
The spontaneous stochasticity is another name for the *butterfly effect* [L69,P14], first conjectured by Ed Lorenz in 1969. It results in an absolute finite time predictability barrier for turbulence or weather forecasting, which is independent of initial errors. In his original paper, Ed Lorenz believed that this predictability barrier was due to the multi-scale nature of the atmosphere.
Since then, this conjecture has been tested on many toy models of turbulence, such as dynamical system [MR23], shell models[M16,B24], Kraichnan model[F01] or Burgers equations[ED15]and in turbulent velocity fields[Th20]. These studies highlighted that another crucial ingredient to observe such effect was the singular nature of the velocity field. To date, it is however not clear whether the nature of the singularity influences the development of the spontaneous stochasticity. In this project, we aim at studying the influence of the dissipative nature of the singularity in a controlled system: the Reversible Navier-Stokes on Log-Lattice. Such system was shown to exhibit a wide variety of finite time blow-ups [C25], some of them being dissipative.
The log-lattice code is already available for the study and works on PCs. Numerical cost involved in this kind of simulations is rather mild, so this topic should rather be viewed as theoretical with light numerics.

1. **Zero-modes in a multifractal random shell model for scalar transport** (ST)
The project aims to analyse numerically and theoretically the emergence of non-Gaussian flatness in multifractal extension of random dyadic model, which can be seen as a shell model version of the Kraichnan model of scalar transport.

1. **Predictability of Kelvin-Helmholtz rings in $\alpha$-turbulence** (ST)
The goal of this project is to numerically  investigate examples of simple singular initial data  for which the 2D Euler equations or their variants,  have non-unique solutions.
One example is the 2D Kelvin-Helmoltz instability. When perturbed by a small noise it is known to give rise to spontaneous stochasticity of vortex sheets. The goal is to numerically investigate the universality of this mechanism when varying the range of interactions between the vortices. 
A second and perhaps simpler case is the initial data proposed by Bressan and Shen, 2019 (arxiv 2002.01962) where   vorticity has a point singularity.

1. **Spontaneous stochasticity of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation**  (ES)

1. **Two-Point Statistics from Fiber Tracking Velocimetry in a turbulent channel flow** (CB)
This project aims at evaluating two-point statistics of a turbulent channel flow using rigid fibers transported by the flow. This technique, recently validated experimentally and numerically in homogeneous isotropic turbulence (Brizzolara et al., PRX, 2021), allows to measure flow transverse velocity increments and even the local turbulent dissipation rate for sufficiently short fibers. Using numerical data, we will apply this technique to a turbulent channel flow, which is inhomogenous and anisotropic. The length and inertia of the fibers will be varied to quantify the effect of these parameters on the measurements.

1. **Dynamical models for the turbulent cascade** (JB)
This project explores simplified dynamical models for the turbulent energy cascade that go beyond phenomenological approaches. The aim is to understand how intermittency, as described by Kolmogorov's 1962 refined self-similarity hypothesis, emerges dynamically from the coupling between scales. Students will construct and analyze stochastic evolution equations for coarse-grained energy transfers, investigating how fluctuations at small scales lead to intermittent statistics. A central aspect is to illustrate Eulerian spontaneous stochasticity, viewed through the lens of renormalization-group ideas, where multiplicative randomness arises from unresolved interactions. Model predictions will be compared with direct numerical simulations, focusing on scaling exponents, intermittency corrections, and the validity of refined similarity across scales.
